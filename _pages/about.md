I am a Ph.D. student at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2023- now), supposed to graduate in spring, 2027. I am supervised by Prof. Chaoping Xing.
In general, my interests include zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, coding theory, etc. In particular, I have a special focus on vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE)-based ZK proofs, and pseudorandom correlation generators.
