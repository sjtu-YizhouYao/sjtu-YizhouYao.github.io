I am a Ph.D. student at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2023- now), supervised by Prof. Chaoping Xing. In general, I have broad interests in zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation. More concretely, these days I am paying particular attentions to distributive proof systems, pseudorandom correlation generators/functions, arithmetic garbled circuits, homomorphic secret sharings, and so on.
